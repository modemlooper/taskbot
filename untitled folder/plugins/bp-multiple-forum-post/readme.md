## Description

This Wordpress plugin adds the ability for users to create new bbpress forum topics in multiple BuddyPress group forums at the same time.

Users will only get one email notification about the new topic, even if it's created in multiple groups that they're a part of: a notice added to the email lets users know what other group forums also had the new topic posted to them.

Users will also only see one entry in their activity feed. Similar to email notifications, information is added about the other groups where the topic was posted, if the user is a member of or has access to more more than one of those groups.

Initial attachments and topic tags are copied to all of the created topics in each group forum. The topics aren't linked beyond that though: new replies and attachments, changes to topic status, etc., will only affect individual topics, not all of them.


## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
